Police officers in riot gear closed in on the protesters, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. Four demonstrators were arrested during a brief confrontation, and attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp.\n\nThe Los Angeles encampment, which had grown to 400 tents and 700-800 people, was one of the largest on the West Coast. The protesters, who included homeless individuals, were joined by supporters from organized labor, clergy, civil rights, and other groups.

The letter, written in May 2012, revealed a change in Kalashnikov's perspective, as he had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his rifle. In the letter, Kalashnikov questioned whether he was to blame for the lives lost, despite his intention to design the rifle to defend his country.\n\nKalashnikov's letter was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and is signed with a wavering hand by the designer, who describes himself as \"a slave of God.\" The letter was typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and is believed to have been composed with the help of a priest, according to his daughter, Elena.\n\nThe AK-47, one of the world's most widely used and recognizable weapons, has been responsible for over 100 million sales worldwide. Kalashnikov designed the rifle during World War II, when he was wounded fighting for the Red Army, and its simplicity and reliability made it a popular choice for military forces. However, the rifle has also been used by terrorists and child soldiers, causing widespread harm and death.\n\nKalashnikov's funeral was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he received many Russian state honors, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour. Despite his fame and recognition, Kalashnikov made little money from his invention.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has taken a stance on the issue, with Patriarch Kirill's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, stating that the Church supports the creators and soldiers who use the rifle when it serves to protect the Fatherland.

Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs: A Growing Concern**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing link between cigarette smoke and the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to the studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for killing bacteria. The smoke-exposed MRSA also becomes better at invading human cells and can cause more severe infections, including pneumonia. The increased resistance to antibiotics and immune responses can lead to a higher mortality rate, as seen in lab studies where smoke-exposed MRSA killed more mice than non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThe researchers suggest that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses and alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This adaptation allows the bacteria to survive longer and become more aggressive. The study also found that the increased resistance to antibiotics and immune responses can be inherited, as MRSA can divide rapidly and generate millions of descendents in a short period.\n\nThe findings of these studies have significant implications for public health, as cigarette smokers are already more susceptible to infectious diseases. The researchers hope that their findings will add to the growing body of evidence that highlights the dangers of smoking and the importance of quitting. The study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, emphasizes that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also assists pathogens, making it a double-edged sword in the fight against infectious diseases.\n\nThe study's findings are a stark reminder of the need to address the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles, including quitting smoking. As the world grapples with the challenges of antibiotic resistance, it is essential to consider the role of cigarette smoke in fueling the growth of superbugs like MRSA.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The study used a method borrowed from Google's PageRank algorithm to analyze links between Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. The initial results showed that Frank Sinatra was the most important person, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was expanded to include 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, the results changed, with Adolf Hitler taking the top spot, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n\nTo address the issue of Wikipedia's bias towards certain figures, the researchers applied a second method called CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links from an article. They then combined PageRank and CheiRank to create a new measure called 2DRank. Using this method, the researchers found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the world.\n\nHowever, a separate study by the same researcher, Young-Ho Eom, found a different result. This study analyzed Wikipedia pages to determine the most influential thinker in the world and found that Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus was the most influential. Linnaeus is known for inventing the scientific system of naming that is still in use today. The study found that Linnaeus was at the center of a large web of links on Wikipedia, with many scientific names leading back to him.\n\nThe study's results were surprising, as Linnaeus is not typically considered one of the most influential historical figures. The researchers attributed the result to the specifics of Linnaeus' scientific work and the way that Wikipedia is structured. In contrast, a previous study found that Karl Marx was the most influential scholar based on how often academics referenced each other in their work.\n\nThe Internet Archive is also working to preserve Wikipedia pages and the links they contain. They are using crawlers to archive pages as they are created and to preserve the pages that they reference. The goal is to fix broken links on the web and to provide a way for people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.\n\nOverall, the studies highlight the complexities of measuring importance and influence, and the different methods that can be used to analyze Wikipedia data.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The condition, which affects the nervous system and causes muscle weakness, has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. The exact cause of AFM remains unknown, but it is believed to be triggered by a viral infection that enters the central nervous system.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include pain in the arms and legs, inability to pass urine, and respiratory failure, which can require urgent ventilator support. The condition can be caused by a variety of germs, including enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain.\n\n**Outbreaks and Cases**\n\nThe AFM outbreak in 2014 coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, but the CDC did not detect traces of the severe respiratory virus in the AFM specimens collected that year. In 2015, the CDC also did not detect the virus in the specimens collected, and only limited sporadic cases of the virus have been detected in the United States in 2016.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nAs of August 2016, there have been 50 confirmed cases of AFM across 24 states, with the majority of cases occurring in children under the age of 21. The median age of patients is 7.6 years, and 61% of patients are males. Limb weakness is asymmetrical in most patients, and cranial nerve motor dysfunction is reported in 34% of cases.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nThere is no specific treatment for AFM, but neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. The best prevention is to wash hands frequently, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect oneself from mosquitoes, which are linked to the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Speech therapy has been shown to be beneficial in some cases.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM.

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, comparing them to the patterns seen on the shroud. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the time of Jesus. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic, and has never officially weighed in on its authenticity.\n\nThe study's conclusions are based on a scientific analysis of the bloodstain patterns, rather than on any assumptions or interpretations.

He also suggested that some behaviors, such as patting someone on the butt, are not as serious as rape or child molestation.\n\nActress Alyssa Milano, a vocal advocate for the #MeToo movement, responded to Damon's comments on Twitter, stating that the outrage over sexual misconduct is not just about individual incidents, but about a systemic issue of gaslighting and silencing of women.

Driver argued that men should not attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women, and that they should instead listen to women's experiences and support them.\n\nDamon's comments were also criticized by other actors and industry professionals, who pointed out that his defense of comedian Louis CK, who has been accused of misconduct, was particularly problematic. Damon stated that he thought CK's remorseful response to the allegations was a sign that he was willing to take responsibility for his actions.\n\nIn a separate interview with ABC News, Damon addressed the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, stating that he knew Weinstein was a \"womanizer\" but did not know about the more serious allegations of misconduct.

The second pregnancy was in 1996, where she discovered that the fetus had a severe brain abnormality, including a condition where the brain had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, making it unlikely for the baby to survive.\n\nDavis writes that she felt the baby was suffering and made the difficult decision to end the pregnancy. She describes the experience as an \"indescribable blackness\" and says it left her forever changed. The loss of the second pregnancy was a key part of her memoir, which is set to be released on Tuesday.\n\nThe disclosure comes as Davis is running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is a staunch opponent of abortion. Davis' filibuster in 2013 temporarily delayed the passage of sweeping new abortion restrictions in Texas, but the measure ultimately passed. A federal judge later blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide.\n\nAnti-abortion groups have expressed sympathy for Davis' difficult decision but emphasized the value of life.

The building, which was used for gatherings and feasts, was found to have been abandoned in a clean and organized manner, suggesting that it was never a permanent residence. The site has yielded a wealth of artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of paleontology with the discovery of a new species of dinosaur, Caihong juji, in northeastern China. The dinosaur, which lived around 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is a crow-sized, bird-like creature with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by paleontologist Xing Xu, who found the fossil in Hebei Province, China. The fossil was exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers, bones, and even its internal organs still intact. The researchers were able to study the fossil in detail and discovered that Caihong juji had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, which were likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals.\n\nThe researchers used powerful microscopes to detect the remnants of organelles called melanosomes, which are responsible for pigmentation, in the dinosaur's feathers. They found that the melanosomes in Caihong juji's feathers were similar to those of hummingbirds, which are known for their iridescent feathers. The researchers were able to reconstruct the dinosaur's plumage and predict that it had a rainbow-like glimmer, with colors that changed depending on the viewing angle.\n\nCaihong juji was a two-legged predator with a Velociraptor-like skull and sharp teeth, and it likely hunted small mammals and lizards. It had a distinctive crest above its eyes and a frond-like tail with asymmetrical feathers, which were likely used for flight. The dinosaur's body was covered in feathers, including long, stiff leading edges on its tail, which would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of birds and the origins of feathers. It suggests that feathers evolved for display purposes, rather than just for flight, and that dinosaurs may have used their feathers to attract mates or intimidate rivals. The discovery also highlights the importance of studying fossilized feathers and their pigmentation to understand the evolution of color vision in animals.\n\nThe researchers believe that Caihong juji may have used its iridescent feathers for display purposes, but they are not sure how it used them or whether males or females of the species had different plumage. Further study of the fossil and other feathered dinosaurs may provide more insights into the evolution of color vision and the origins of birds.\n\nIn conclusion", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, was implemented to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for community projects, and subsidize healthy food purchases for low-income families. However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and has driven sales outside city limits.\n\nBusinesses, such as Costco, have seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where they can buy the product without the tax. This has led to a loss of revenue for the city, with some businesses reporting a 34% decline in sales of taxed beverages.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, exempting sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

According to the California Attorney General's database, there are currently 35 people listed as missing in the county, with some cases dating back to 1977. However, a closer examination of the data reveals that many of these cases are not as straightforward as they seem.\n\nOne notable case is that of Bekah Martinez, a 22-year-old woman who was reported missing in November 2017 by her mother. However, it was later discovered that Martinez was actually a contestant on the reality TV show \"The Bachelor.\" Her case highlights the challenges of investigating missing persons cases, particularly when individuals may be intentionally avoiding contact with family and friends.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office attributes the high rate of missing persons to the local cannabis industry, which attracts people from all over the country and can lead to individuals going off the grid for extended periods. However, this explanation is not the only factor contributing to the high number of missing persons in the county.\n\nThe North Coast Journal analyzed data from the Attorney General's office and found that many of the missing persons cases in Humboldt County are actually related to runaway children, with the county ranking sixth in the state per capita for missing children reports between 2010 and 2016. However, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) does not consider Humboldt County to be a high-risk area for missing children.\n\nThe Journal also found that some people listed as missing are not actually missing, but rather have chosen to cut off contact with their families or are living off the grid. In some cases, family members have reported their loved ones missing due to a lack of communication, only to later discover that they were safe and sound.\n\nThe article also highlights the challenges faced by families of missing persons, particularly those who are searching for loved ones who have disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff Joseph disappeared in 2014, has been working tirelessly to find him, but has faced frustration and lack of cooperation from the sheriff's office.\n\nThe article concludes that the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County is complex and multifaceted, and that a one-size-fits-all approach is not sufficient to address the problem. It highlights the need for better communication and cooperation between law enforcement agencies, as well as the importance of considering the unique circumstances of each case.\n\n**Key", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

This news comes as a surprise to many, as Snooki has been open about her partying lifestyle and has been known to drink heavily.\n\nThe news of Snooki's pregnancy has sparked concerns about the potential risks of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). FASDs are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy, and can result in physical and neurodevelopmental problems, including growth deficiency, facial abnormalities, and central nervous system damage.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FASDs are preventable by avoiding alcohol during pregnancy. However, many women continue to drink during pregnancy, with about 10% of pregnant women in the United States reporting drinking in the last month. The risk of FASDs depends on the amount and frequency of alcohol consumption, as well as the timing of consumption during pregnancy.\n\nIn an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Snooki admitted to overdrinking and waking up in strange places, including a garbage can. She also stated that she doesn't want to be a role model and that living with reckless abandon is not always fun. This admission raises concerns about Snooki's ability to provide a safe and healthy environment for her unborn child.\n\nThe news of Snooki's pregnancy has also sparked speculation about the potential impact on her career and her reality TV show.

Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and even bragged about knowing her driving speed and routes. Arias likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal.\n\nArias claims that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, citing invasion of her privacy.

The study analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers in the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002.\n\nResearchers found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were associated with higher risks of ADHD-like behaviors in their children.

However, the study's authors emphasize that the results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, advises pregnant women to avoid taking acetaminophen frequently until more studies have been done. She suggests that women may want to try non-pharmacological ways to manage pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture. Dr. Ritz also notes that the study does not mean that pregnant women should never take acetaminophen, but rather that they should use it judiciously and in moderation.\n\nThe study's findings are not conclusive, and other experts have raised concerns about the study's limitations. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist, notes that the study does not show a causal link between acetaminophen use and ADHD, and that there are many variables that need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD often runs in families.\n\nThe manufacturer of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, has responded to the study by stating that acetaminophen has a favorable safety profile when used as directed, and that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of carefully considering the risks and benefits of acetaminophen use during pregnancy, and suggests that pregnant women may want to explore alternative ways to manage pain and discomfort.", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

President Barack Obama has also stated that he would veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans, and has convinced his caucus to stand firm against any concessions.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The mission aims to explore the sun's atmosphere and answer long-standing questions about the solar wind and the sun's corona. The Parker Solar Probe will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, closer than any spacecraft has ever been before, and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe spacecraft will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from the intense heat and radiation, while keeping the science instruments at room temperature. The probe will make 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within 3.9 million miles of the solar surface. The mission will help scientists understand the physics of stars, improve forecasting of major space weather events, and provide insight into the solar wind and its impact on Earth.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will also help protect equipment from solar radiation and improve our understanding of the sun's corona, which is hotter than the sun's surface. The mission is scheduled to launch in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun.\n\nThe mission's science objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings from the mission will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will change our understanding of the sun and its impact on our solar system. It is the first time a spacecraft will be named for a living person, and it is a testament to the importance of Eugene Parker's body of work. The mission is expected to provide many surprises and will help us better understand the sun and its effects on our planet.\n\nThe mission has significant implications for our understanding of space weather and its impact on Earth.

The lion had escaped from the park and was surrounded by hundreds of bystanders, who were taking selfies with the animal. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said that the decision to shoot the lion was taken as a last resort after the animal became agitated and attacked the man, and that tranquilizers were not available at the time.\n\nMohawk's death sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with many using the hashtag #JusticeforMohawk to express their outrage and disappointment. The incident highlights the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park in South Africa and was being hunted by wildlife officials, who were considering killing it due to the threat it posed to humans.

The report and testimony revealed that major data companies, including Acxiom, Experian, Epsilon, and Equifax, are collecting and selling deeply personal information about consumers, including sensitive health conditions, financial data, and even lists of rape victims, seniors with dementia, and people with HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe data brokers are selling this information to marketers, who use it to target consumers based on their income, clothing size, and other personal characteristics. The lists are often compiled from a wide range of sources, including consumer purchases, online activity, and even medical records. The data brokers are not required to maintain the privacy of this information, and many consumers are unaware that their data is being collected and sold.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization, uncovered these lists while investigating data brokers' practices. The group's executive director, Pam Dixon, testified before Congress that the existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations. Dixon stated that the lists are often used to target vulnerable individuals, such as police officers, seniors with dementia, and those suffering from addiction.\n\nThe current lack of regulations allows data brokers to sell sensitive information without consequence. While medical privacy laws prohibit doctors from sharing patient information, data brokers can collect and sell medical information obtained from other sources, such as over-the-counter drug purchases. This has led to the creation of lists that could put people in harm's way, such as a list of police officers' home addresses.\n\nThe Direct Marketing Association, a trade group representing data brokers, acknowledged that some lists may be used to disparage certain groups, but claimed that such lists represent a \"tiny minority\" of marketing products. However, many data brokers have unclear or no opt-out procedures, making it difficult for consumers to protect their information.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee and the Federal Trade Commission have called for increased transparency and regulation of the data brokerage industry. Committee chairman John \"Jay\" Rockefeller criticized data brokers for resisting oversight and vowed to continue pushing for information on how they collect and sell data.

The planet is thought to be located at an average distance of 20 times farther away from the sun than Neptune and would take 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete one orbit around the sun.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now classified as a dwarf planet for a reason. He believes that the controversy will eventually die down as people become more comfortable with the idea of Pluto not being a planet.\n\nBrown's discovery of Planet Nine is not the first time he has made headlines in the scientific community. In 2005, he discovered the dwarf planet Eris, which was found to be more massive than Pluto, leading to the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet. Brown's work has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of the outer reaches of the solar system and has sparked a new era of exploration and discovery.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with scientists using powerful telescopes to try and detect the planet's presence. While it may take several years to confirm the existence of the planet, Brown and his team are optimistic that it will be discovered soon. The discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant milestone in the field of astronomy and would provide new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.\n\nIn related news, NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system, and that the Sagan Rule applies, which states that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\" However, Brown and his team are confident that their findings are robust and that the discovery of Planet Nine is a real possibility.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Planet Nine has sparked a new wave of", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. Cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation in the arteries can lead to atherosclerosis, which can block the blood supply to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining weight loss over time. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Many people are motivated to lose weight, but then they feel they can take it easy. This information can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. Researchers have found that people with coronary heart disease who experience large fluctuations in weight over time are at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nThe study's results suggest that maintaining a stable weight is crucial for people with coronary artery disease. Dr. Bangalore noted that the study's findings warrant further investigation and that more research is needed to understand the causes of weight fluctuations and how to help people keep weight off.\n\nIn addition to the study's findings, it is essential to understand the underlying causes of coronary artery disease. The condition is characterized by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis and block the blood supply to the heart. A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help prevent and treat coronary artery disease.\n\nOverall, the study", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease that primarily affects older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of cases were in individuals under 50. These younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had better five-year survival rates, with 95.1% surviving localized disease, 76% surviving regional disease, and 21.3% surviving distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults.

While some experts argue that the data do not yet support expanding screening to younger age groups, others believe that the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors will require long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting colorectal cancer in younger adults, as well as a reevaluation of current screening guidelines to ensure that they are effective in preventing cancer deaths.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "A groundbreaking discovery has been made in the Flinders Ranges of southern Australia, revealing a human settlement dating back 49,000 years. The site, known as Warratyi rock-shelter, was discovered by chance when a colleague of archaeologist Giles Hamm needed to use the restroom. Hamm and his team, working with local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard, excavated the site and found over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the known dates of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 10,000 years, with Hamm suggesting that people may have moved south from the northern part of the continent to the southern interior much earlier than previously thought. The site also contains the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like species that is now extinct.\n\nThe artefacts found at the site include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, which suggest that early humans developed these technologies locally. The discovery challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe site has been dated using a combination of optical dating and radiocarbon dating, with the results indicating that humans occupied the site from 49,000 to 46,000 years ago. The discovery is significant not only because of its age but also because it shows that humans were able to adapt to the arid environment of the Flinders Ranges, which was previously thought to be inhospitable to human habitation.\n\nThe find is also important because it provides evidence of the ingenuity of the oldest continuous civilization on Earth, which is the Aboriginal Australian civilization. The discovery has been hailed as a major milestone in the study of Australian prehistory and has the potential to rewrite the story of human settlement in Australia.\n\nThe discovery has also sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used. However, the majority of experts agree that the discovery is significant and has the potential to change our understanding of human settlement in Australia.\n\nIn addition to the artefacts and bone fragments, the site also contains evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum. The discovery of these remains in a well-dated and well-stratified context suggests that early humans were interacting with these animals, which is a significant finding in the debate over whether humans or climate change", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**The Quest for Energy: A Universal Expansion**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of the Kardashev scale, a measure of a civilization's energy consumption. The scale, proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, consists of three levels: Level I, where a civilization harnesses all the resources of a planet; Level II, where it harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Level III, where it harnesses all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nAccording to Hooper, the universe's expansion, driven by dark energy, poses a significant challenge to civilizations seeking to expand their energy resources. As the universe expands, stars beyond our Local Group will eventually become inaccessible, limiting the amount of energy that can be extracted from them. To overcome this limitation, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations would use a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and harness the energy of stars. These satellites would be made up of millions of individual solar-powered satellites that would hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet. This concept was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been explored in science fiction, including in the works of authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres has also been explored in the context of searching for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). By detecting the waste heat emitted by advanced civilizations, scientists may be able to identify the presence of Dyson spheres. Hooper suggests that astronomers could look for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away, which would indicate the presence of advanced civilizations.\n\nWhile the concept of Dyson spheres is still purely theoretical, it highlights the challenges and opportunities that arise from the universe's expansion. As the universe continues to expand, civilizations will need to find innovative ways to harness energy and expand their resources. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the study of advanced civilizations will continue to be an exciting area of research, with the potential to reveal new insights into the nature of the universe and our place within it.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

He clashed with some of the holdover writers from the Kilborn era, who were resistant to change. However, Stewart eventually found allies in writers Ben Karlin and David Javerbaum, who shared his vision for a more satirical and irreverent show.\n\nThe show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and Mo Rocca, were initially focused on creating humorous field pieces, often targeting eccentric individuals. However, Stewart encouraged them to aim higher, targeting politicians and the media. A breakthrough moment came when Steve Carell asked Senator John McCain a pointed question on his bus during the 2000 campaign, which was a turning point for the show.\n\nUnder Stewart's leadership, The Daily Show began to focus on deconstructing the process of politics and the media, rather than just making jokes. The show's correspondents were encouraged to ask tough questions and challenge the status quo. The show's popularity grew, and it became a cultural touchstone for a new generation of viewers.\n\nThe Daily Show's success was also due in part to the talents of its correspondents, who were able to bring a unique perspective and humor to the show.

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations at the site have uncovered evidence of Middle Stone Age tools, which are the oldest of their kind, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. These tools, including spearpoints and small implements, were made from obsidian, a volcanic glass, and were transported from as far as 25-50 kilometers away, indicating long-distance trade networks among early human populations.\n\nThe discovery suggests that human ancestors were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies in response to climate fluctuations. The researchers propose that the development of smaller, more specialized tools allowed early humans to forage over larger areas and acquire resources more efficiently.\n\nThe findings also indicate that early humans were able to extract and use pigments, such as red ochre, for symbolic purposes, possibly for painting themselves or their belongings. This is the earliest evidence of pigment extraction and use in the archaeological record.\n\nThe discovery of Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin challenges the long-held view that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that these behaviors arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated modern humans.\n\nThe researchers propose that the transition to Middle Stone Age technology was driven by long-term climate change and environmental fluctuations, which forced early humans to adapt and innovate in order to survive. The discovery of complex behaviors, such as long-distance trade networks and the use of exotic materials, suggests that early humans were able to develop and transmit technological skills through successive generations.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern may not have been a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over thousands of years.\n\nThe discovery of Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin also highlights the complexity and diversity of human evolution in Africa, where multiple species of hominins coexisted and interacted with each other. The findings demonstrate that early humans were able to develop and use complex technologies, such as obsidian tools and pigment extraction, and that these behaviors were not unique to modern humans.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin provides new insights into the evolution of human behavior and technology, and challenges our current understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

However, the Canadian government ignored the request and said it would never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine.\n\nIn 1999, Canada's federal court ruled that Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not telling authorities about his collaboration with the Nazis, but could find no evidence he committed atrocities.

The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees.\n\nIn September 2011, federal marshals raided Gibson's facilities in Tennessee, seizing wood and shutting down production. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the government has not provided clear evidence of wrongdoing and that the company has been unfairly targeted. Gibson has been accused of trafficking in illegally obtained wood from Madagascar, where a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood was in place.\n\nHowever, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood, and the company's own emails suggest that they took steps to maintain a supply chain connected to illegal timber harvests. Gibson denies these allegations, claiming that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also raised concerns among guitar builders and dealers, who worry about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for owners to be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments, which has led some dealers to eliminate overseas business to avoid potential delays and complications.\n\nIn contrast, some in the industry, such as Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., support the Lacey Act, seeing it as a necessary measure to prevent unscrupulous operators from engaging in illegal logging. The EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the law, stating that its intent is to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing is essential.\n\nAs the case against Gibson continues to unfold, the music and environmental communities are watching closely to see how the law will be enforced and what constitutes responsible wood sourcing.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

In response, Hamas fired rockets into Israel, including one that landed near Jerusalem for the first time in decades.\n\nThe Israeli cabinet has authorized the mobilization of up to 75,000 reservists, preparing for a possible ground invasion of Gaza. Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil visited Gaza on Friday, denouncing Israeli aggression and offering to mediate a truce.

NASA scientists have made significant discoveries about the planet's ancient history, which challenges previous assumptions about the presence of water on Mars.\n\n**A Global Ocean on Mars**\n\nUsing infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere, researchers have found evidence of a massive ocean that covered about 20% of the planet's surface, equivalent to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. The ocean was estimated to be around 1 mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This ancient ocean would have provided a habitable environment for life to emerge and thrive.\n\n**Water Loss on Mars**\n\nThe scientists used the concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, to infer how much water Mars has lost over time. The results showed that the planet has lost a significant amount of water, equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in the polar ice caps. This water loss would have led to a decrease in the planet's atmospheric pressure, causing the ocean to recede and eventually freeze.\n\n**Habitable Environment**\n\nThe discovery of a global ocean on Mars suggests that the planet was once habitable, with conditions suitable for life to emerge and evolve. The presence of water, along with geological processes, would have created a stable environment for life to thrive. While there is no conclusive evidence of life on Mars, the possibility of life existing on the planet in the past is now more plausible.\n\n**Comparison with Earth**\n\nThe study also highlights the similarities between Earth and Mars in terms of their water composition. Both planets started with identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water. However, Mars' weaker gravity led to the loss of ordinary hydrogen, resulting in a higher proportion of deuterium in its water. This difference in water composition has helped scientists estimate the amount of water that once existed on Mars.\n\n**Future Research**\n\nThe discovery of a global ocean on Mars has significant implications for future research on the planet. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover, set to launch in 2018, will search for chemical signatures of life on Mars. The rover will focus on the Martian soil, where water is believed to have existed in the past.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The film, starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie, is a caper about a veteran con man and his young apprentice. The movie's plot is described as ridiculous and absurd, with a lack of truth and no real revelation of the secret underworld it claims to expose. However, the film's charm lies in its portrayal of Will Smith's jaded charm and Margot Robbie's transformation from a clumsy thief to a skilled con artist.\n\nThe casting of the film was a highly publicized process, with several A-list actors considered for the lead roles. Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck were all considered for the male lead, while Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Kristen Stewart, Michelle Williams, Jessica Biel, Rose Byrne, and Olivia Munn were all considered for the female lead. Ultimately, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were chosen for the roles.\n\nThe film's directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aimed to create a movie that captures the effortless allure of a classic Hitchcock film. They succeeded in bringing out Will Smith's charm, which has been a hallmark of his career since his days as a rapper and his breakout role in \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\" Smith's character, Nicky Spurgeon, is a con artist who uses his charm to persuade people to part with their money.\n\nThe film's success lies in its ability to balance humor and tension, with a cast of characters that are both likable and untrustworthy. The movie's R rating allows for some raunchy wit and humor, which adds to its playful tone. Margot Robbie's performance as Jess Barrett is also praised, as she brings a modern take on the classic \"damsel in distress\" trope.\n\nOverall, \"Focus\" is a fun and entertaining film that is more about the characters and their relationships than about the plot.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has dismissed appeals from both companies, sending the case back to the EU's trademark office for further review.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit in Europe. Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, opposed the application, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The EU's trademark office initially granted the trademark, but Mondelez appealed, and the case has been ongoing for over a decade.\n\nIn 2016, a lower EU court ruled that Nestlé had failed to provide evidence that the shape was distinctive in all EU countries, and the trademark was annulled. Nestlé and the EU's trademark office appealed, but the ECJ has now dismissed their appeals, ruling that the trademark office must review the 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark.\n\nThe ruling leaves open the possibility that the trademark agency could preserve protection for KitKat's shape if new evidence is presented showing that the shape is distinctive in more countries. However, the case has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets.\n\nThe dispute has also been mirrored in British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The case has been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has even featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe outcome of the case is not yet clear, but it is likely to have significant implications for the chocolate industry and the way brands protect their intellectual property across the EU.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is common in birds, particularly those with larger body sizes, such as doves and ostriches.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization. The researchers also found that this behavior has evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays.\n\nGary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" has also shed light on how dinosaurs might have sounded. In an interview, he revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the iconic roars and hisses of the movie's dinosaurs. For example, the T. rex roar was created by combining the sounds of a baby elephant, a tiger, and an alligator, while the velociraptor hiss was inspired by a goose.\n\nThe study's findings are based on the analysis of bird vocalizations and the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and related outgroups. The researchers used a statistical approach to identify the species that use closed-mouth vocalization and found that it is more common in larger-bodied birds. They also found that the inflation of an elastic cavity, such as the esophageal pouch, is a size-dependent challenge that may have limited the evolution of closed-mouth vocalization in smaller birds.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, said that the findings suggest that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times and can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays. The study's co-author, Julia Clarke, added that understanding how living birds vocalize is crucial to making sense of what nonavian dinosaurs sounded like. The study's findings offer a new perspective on the sounds of the ancient world and suggest that dinosaurs may have had a more bird-like vocalization than previously thought.\n\nIn summary, the study suggests that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, and", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

Statistical tools, particularly Bayesian statistics, have been used to refine and focus the search for the plane. Bayesian statisticians, such as Lawrence D. Stone and Colleen Keller, have successfully used these methods to locate missing objects, including an Air France plane that crashed in 2009.\n\nBayesian statistics, named after 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, allow for the assessment of various scenarios and the combination of probabilities to determine the most likely solution. This approach is useful in situations where there is incomplete or uncertain information. In the case of the Air France plane, Keller and her team used Bayesian statistics to narrow down the search area from a huge radius to a much smaller one, ultimately leading to the discovery of the plane's wreckage.\n\nThe same approach is being considered for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 search. However, the search area is vast, and the Indian Ocean's unpredictable currents make it challenging to locate the plane. Colleen Keller, who worked on the Air France case, expressed doubts about finding the plane, stating that it's \"very likely if we don't get any breakthroughs, it's at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and we will never find it, sadly.\"\n\nThe use of Bayesian statistics in search operations has its challenges, including the need to quantify subjective judgment and account for uncertainties. Some experts, such as Bradley Efron, argue that Bayesian methods are not suitable for situations where new evidence drastically changes the situation. However, others, like Tony O'Hagan, believe that Bayesian techniques are essential for adapting to changing information and bringing discipline to the search process.\n\nThe Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines have not publicly disclosed whether they are using Bayesian statistics in their search efforts.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

He was a rare star who seemed excited to work on projects that resonated with his young fans, and his movies left a lasting impression on their lives. His legacy can be measured in the joy and comfort he brought to audiences, as well as the memories and laughter he inspired.\n\nDespite his success, Williams struggled with the pressures of fame and the expectations that came with it. In a poignant moment, he was quoted as saying \"Help me\" in a stage whisper, referencing the 1950s science fiction classic \"The Fly.\" This moment has stayed with those who knew him, and it is a reminder of the complexity and vulnerability that lay beneath his brilliant exterior.\n\nWilliams' death was met with shock and sadness, and his passing has left a void in the entertainment industry and in the hearts of his fans.

This event is a combination of a Blue Moon, a Supermoon, and a total lunar eclipse, making it a unique and spectacular sight.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\nA Blue Moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single month, which happens approximately once every 2.7 years. The second full moon in a month is called a Blue Moon.\n\n**What is a Supermoon?**\nA Supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**What is a Total Lunar Eclipse?**\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon. This causes the moon to take on a reddish hue, earning it the nickname \"Blood Moon.\"\n\n**When and Where to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse**\nThe Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, the Pacific, and western North America on January 31, 2018. The eclipse will begin at 11:48 UTC and reach its maximum at 13:30 UTC. Viewers in eastern North America will need to wake up early to catch the partial eclipse.\n\n**How to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse**\nThe Virtual Telescope project will provide a livestream of the eclipse from Australia, starting at 11:30 UTC. Alternatively, viewers can watch the eclipse with the naked eye, as it is safe to do so.\n\n**Tips for Photographing the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse**\nTo capture stunning photos of the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse, use a smartphone or DSLR camera and adjust the exposure settings accordingly. For a unique shot, put the moon in context with a local landmark.\n\n**Rare Occurrence**\nThe Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse is a rare occurrence, with the next one happening on December 31, 2028, and January 31, 2037.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night.
