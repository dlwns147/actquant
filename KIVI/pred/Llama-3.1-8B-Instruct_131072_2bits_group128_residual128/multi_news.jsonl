The movement, which aims to bring attention to economic inequality and corporate power, has been met with varying degrees of resistance from local authorities.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Occupy Philadelphia movement remained peaceful on the evening of November 28, with around 100 protesters remaining on the City Hall lawn despite a 5 p.m. deadline set by Mayor Michael Nutter. Police officials had initially threatened to evict the protesters, but ultimately decided to wait until the next day to take action. The protesters, who were mostly students, artists, and homeless individuals, were served squash soup and water, and used the \"human mic\" system of amplification to express their messages.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Occupy L.A. movement, which had grown to over 400 tents and 700 people, was met with a midnight deadline to vacate City Hall Park. Despite the deadline, the protesters remained on the streets, with some even setting up a human barricade to block the police. However, the police, who were equipped with riot gear and non-lethal weapons, decided not to use force and instead waited until the morning rush hour to clear the streets. The standoff ended with four arrests and no major violence, with the police showing restraint in their actions.\n\nIn contrast, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered the protesters to disperse or face arrest. However, the police did not make any arrests, and instead waited until the morning rush hour to clear the streets. The protesters, who had been joined by supporters from various groups, including labor, clergy, and civil rights organizations, remained peaceful and calm throughout the night.\n\nThe mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, had initially been accommodating to the Occupy L.A. movement, providing them with ponchos and other supplies. However, after the collapse of negotiations, he ordered the protesters to vacate the park. The mayor's statement emphasized the importance of the movement's message, but also the need for the protesters to focus on spreading their message of economic justice and balance in American society.\n\nThe Occupy movement has been met with varying degrees of resistance from local authorities, with some cities opting for a more peaceful approach, while others have used force to clear the", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park.

The letter, published in the pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, reveals a complex and nuanced side of the man who designed the rifle that has become synonymous with violence and conflict.\n\nKalashnikov, who died on December 23, 2023, at the age of 94, designed the AK-47 in 1947, after being wounded in World War II. The rifle's simplicity, reliability, and affordability made it a staple of modern warfare, with over 100 million units sold worldwide. However, its widespread use by insurgent groups, including child soldiers, weighed heavily on Kalashnikov's conscience.\n\nIn his letter, Kalashnikov expressed his spiritual pain and guilt over the lives lost due to his invention, questioning whether he was responsible for the deaths caused by his creation. He also revealed that he had converted to Christianity at the age of 91, after being baptized in a church. The letter was typed on his personal writing paper and signed with a wavering hand, adding to the emotional weight of the message.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church, to which Kalashnikov had converted, responded to his letter by stating that the Church supports the creators and soldiers who use the rifle to defend their country, but not those who use it for nefarious purposes. The Church's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, stated that Kalashnikov's intention was to defend his country, not to be used by terrorists.\n\nKalashnikov's legacy is complex and multifaceted, with some seeing him as a hero who designed a rifle to defend his country, while others view him as a man responsible for the deaths of countless people. His letter to the Patriarch Kirill has sparked a debate about the morality of war and the impact of technology on society.\n\nIn related news, the Internet Archive, a non-profit organization, has been collecting and archiving internet data since 1996, including web pages, images, and other online content.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also fuels the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making them more aggressive and harder to kill.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant to the reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides used by the immune system to kill bacteria. This resistance was found to be dose-dependent, with higher concentrations of smoke extract making the bacteria more resistant. Moreover, the study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was able to adhere better to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infections.\n\nAnother study led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, found that cigarette smoke exposure stressed MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances and enhance its survival against the immune system. This stress response was found to be four times more pronounced in MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract compared to those not exposed.\n\nThe study also found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was more resistant to macrophage killing, with the bacteria able to adhere better to human cells and cause more severe infections. Furthermore, the increased resistance was found to be long-lasting, with the bacteria remaining resistant for up to 24 hours after exposure.\n\nThe researchers also compared the effects of cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA, finding that cigarette smoke made the bacteria more resistant to the immune system's defenses, while e-cigarette vapor had a lesser effect. The study suggested that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nThe findings of these studies have significant implications for public health, highlighting the need to avoid smoking and the potential risks associated with it. The researchers hope that their findings will add to the growing body of evidence that supports the need to quit smoking and reduce the use of tobacco products.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Cigarette smoke fuels the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making them more aggressive and harder to kill.\n* MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke is more resistant to the", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

{"pred": "A recent study conducted by University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom has shed light on the most influential figures in the world, with surprising results. The study analyzed 24 major language editions of Wikipedia to determine who the most important people are, and the results were quite unexpected.\n\nInitially, the study found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the English-language world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was expanded to include all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, the results changed dramatically. According to the study, the most important person in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist who lived in the 18th century. Linnaeus was a renowned taxonomist who developed the system of naming species that is still used today.\n\nThe study used a combination of algorithms, including PageRank and CheiRank, to determine the importance of individuals. PageRank measures the number of incoming links to a page, while CheiRank measures the number of outgoing links. By combining these two metrics, the study found that Linnaeus was the most influential person in the world, followed by other notable figures such as Adolf Hitler, Pope Pius XII, and Michael Jackson.\n\nHowever, when the study was repeated using a different method, the results changed again. This time, the study found that the most influential person in the world was actually the person who had the most outgoing links, or the person who was most referenced by others. According to this method, the most influential person in the world was actually Carl Linnaeus, but the study also found that the most influential person in the world was actually a different person, depending on the language edition of Wikipedia.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of the internet in preserving historical knowledge and the impact of broken links on the web. The Internet Archive is working to preserve web pages and their references, even if the original links are broken. This is done by creating a snapshot of the web page as it existed at the time it was referenced, and then preserving the reference to the archived page.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of building on the work of others in achieving success. As Sir Isaac Newton famously said, \"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" The study found that the most influential people in the world are those who have built on the work of others, and have been referenced by many others.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of taxonomy and the work of Carl Linnaeus in naming", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 50 cases of AFM across 24 states, with the majority of cases occurring in children under the age of 21.\n\nThe symptoms of AFM include weakness in the arms and legs, difficulty breathing, and facial drooping. In severe cases, the condition can lead to respiratory failure, requiring ventilator support. While there is no specific treatment for AFM, doctors are advising good hygiene practices such as washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and disinfecting surfaces to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe CDC is working with state and local health departments to investigate the cause of the outbreak and to develop a plan for prevention and treatment.

The dispute centers around a priceless guitar played by Kurt Cobain in Nirvana's 1993 \"MTV Unplugged\" concert, which is believed to be worth several times its original $1 million insurance value. Frances Bean claims that the guitar was never gifted to Silva, but rather is a treasured family heirloom that should remain with her. However, Silva disputes this, stating that Frances gave him the guitar as a wedding present in 2014.\n\nThe disagreement has led to a deadlock in negotiations, with a judge ordering Frances to pay Silva $15,000 per month in spousal support as part of an interim settlement. However, Silva is now seeking more substantial support, requesting $25,000 per month in spousal support, citing that he would be left with nothing without Frances' financial support. Silva claims that Frances promised to cover his expenses, including his child's private school and housing costs, when they got married in 2014.\n\nIn a separate court filing, Silva is seeking spousal support from Frances, stating that she has upwards of $100 million in her father's estate and that he deserves half of the money she earned from business deals made during their two-year marriage.

The film, which tells the story of Strayed's 1,100-mile hike along the PCT, has inspired many to attempt the challenging trek. According to the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA), the website traffic has increased by 300% since the movie's release, with a corresponding increase in requests for long-distance hiking permits.\n\nThe PCT, which spans 2,650 miles from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, has traditionally been a relatively quiet and solitary experience. However, with the influx of new hikers, the trail is facing overcrowding issues. The PCTA has implemented a quota system, limiting the number of hikers to 50 per day, but this has not been enough to mitigate the wear and tear on the trail and the environment.\n\nThe PCTA has reported a significant increase in permit requests, with over 4,000 long-distance hiking permits issued in 2016, compared to 300 in 2006. The number of hikers attempting the entire length of the trail has also increased, with over 3,000 people attempting the northbound hike in 2016, and hundreds more attempting the southbound hike.\n\nThe increased number of hikers has put a strain on the trail and the surrounding environment, with concerns about the impact on fragile desert ecosystems. The US Forest Service has reported that there have been 20 rescues already this year, with many more expected. The PCTA is also concerned about the financial costs associated with the increased number of hikers, including helicopter evacuations and searches.\n\nThe PCTA is urging hikers to be mindful of their impact on the trail and the environment, and to practice \"leave no trace\" principles. The organization is also promoting a campaign called #responsiblywild, which aims to promote safe and responsible hiking practices.\n\nIn addition to the environmental concerns, the increased number of hikers has also led to a change in the demographics of the hiker community. According to the PCTA, the number of women hikers has increased, with some estimates suggesting that women now make up 30% of hikers, up from fewer than 10% in the past.\n\nThe PCTA is also promoting the idea of section hiking, which allows hikers to experience the trail without attempting the entire length. The organization is promoting a variety of accessible and scenic sections", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said.

The dinosaur was a small, two-legged predator with a bird-like body and a distinctive crest on its head. However, what's most remarkable about Caihong is its iridescent feathers, which shimmered and changed color like those of modern hummingbirds. The discovery was made in northeastern China, where a local farmer, Yang Jan, found the fossil in 2014.\n\nThe scientists who studied the fossil, led by Dongyu Hu, found that the dinosaur's feathers were preserved in an exceptional state, with some of them even retaining their original colors. The team used advanced technology to analyze the melanosomes, the pigment-containing structures within the feathers, and found that they were similar to those found in modern hummingbirds. The melanosomes were long, flat, and organized into sheets, which is a characteristic of iridescent feathers.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong's iridescent feathers is significant because it suggests that dinosaurs used their feathers for display purposes, rather than just for flight. The team believes that the dinosaur's plumage may have been used to attract mates or to intimidate rivals. The dinosaur's body was about the size of a duck, and it likely lived in forests, where it preyed on small mammals and lizards.\n\nThe study of Caihong's feathers has also provided new insights into the evolution of color in dinosaurs. The team found that the dinosaur's feathers were not just black and white, but had a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. This is the first time that scientists have been able to study the original colors of a dinosaur's feathers.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong has also shed new light on the evolution of flight in dinosaurs. The team found that the dinosaur's tail was asymmetrical, with some feathers being longer than others, which is a characteristic of modern birds. This suggests that Caihong may have been able to glide or fly, but not flap its wings like modern birds.\n\nThe study of Caihong's feathers has also provided new insights into the evolution of the bird family tree. The team found that the dinosaur's feathers were similar to those of modern birds, but also had some unique characteristics that set it apart from its modern relatives.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax has been deemed regressive, with low-income families being disproportionately affected by the increased prices of sugary drinks.\n\nThe tax has led to significant price increases for consumers, with a case of Gatorade costing $26.33, up from $15.99. Retailers like Costco have seen a decline in sales, with a 34% drop in sales of affected beverages in their Cook County locations. The tax has also led to a shift in consumer behavior, with people voting with their feet and buying drinks outside of Seattle.\n\nThe tax has been a contentious issue, with various groups and individuals speaking out against it. Former Mayor Ed Murray, who supported the tax, has been criticized for his handling of the issue. The tax has also been compared to the failed Cook County, Illinois, tax, which was repealed after just two months.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in reducing sugar consumption. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University found that Seattle's tax was one of the most paternalistic laws in the country, with politicians trying to dictate what people can and cannot consume.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its impact on small businesses, with the Illinois Retail Merchants Association stating that the tax has led to a decline in sales and an increase in lost sales for retailers.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that women who took acetaminophen during pregnancy were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and similar disorders.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, emphasized that while the findings do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship, they suggest that frequent or long-term use of acetaminophen may be associated with an increased risk of ADHD. The study controlled for other factors, such as infections and genetic predisposition, and found that the risk of ADHD was 29% higher for women who reported taking acetaminophen.\n\nThe study's findings are not conclusive, but they do suggest that pregnant women should be cautious when taking acetaminophen, especially if they are taking it frequently or for extended periods.

The House has approved a plan to fund federal agencies through December 15, but with conditions related to the new health law, which the Senate is expected to reject.\n\n**House and Senate at Odds**\n\nThe House has passed a spending bill that includes a one-year delay of the new health law and a repeal of the medical device tax. However, Senate Democrats are expected to reject this bill, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been pushing for a hardline stance against any concessions to the GOP. Reid has been urging President Obama to take a tough stance, and the White House has been backing him up.\n\n**Impact of a Shutdown**\n\nA government shutdown would have significant effects on the Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors. The region could lose an estimated $200 million a day, with 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown would also impact tourism, with the Smithsonian museums and other federally funded attractions closing. Child-care centers would also be affected, with parents and child-care workers facing uncertainty.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe Washington region's economy is already weak, and a shutdown would exacerbate the situation. The region has lost 26,500 jobs in August due to sequestration cuts, and the federal payroll has decreased by $2 billion. A shutdown would further impact the region's economy, with lost income tax revenue and reduced spending on local businesses.\n\n**Congressional Response**\n\nCongress is divided on the issue, with some lawmakers calling for a shutdown to force the White House to negotiate. However, others are warning of the devastating effects of a shutdown. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA) said that a shutdown would have a disproportionate effect on the Washington region, while Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-VA) is concerned about the impact on law enforcement agencies.\n\n**Possible Solutions**\n\nA short-term funding bill could be passed to buy more time for an agreement, but it is unclear how this would materialize.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The company's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, announced that Netflix will now offer unlimited maternity and paternity leave to its employees during the first year after a child's birth or adoption. This policy allows employees to take as much time as they need, with the option to return to work on a part-time or full-time basis, or to take additional time off as needed.\n\nThis policy is part of Netflix's \"freedom and responsibility\" culture, which emphasizes the importance of work-life balance and employee well-being. The company believes that by giving employees the flexibility to care for their families without worrying about work or finances, they will be more focused and productive when they return to work.\n\nThis move is a significant departure from the traditional approach of offering limited paid leave. Netflix's unlimited time-off policy, which has been in place for some time, has been a major draw for employees, and this new policy is expected to be a major selling point for top talent in the industry.\n\nThe policy is also notable for its inclusivity, as it extends the same benefits to both mothers and fathers, recognizing that both parents play a significant role in caring for a new child. This is a significant step forward for the tech industry, which has traditionally been slow to adopt family-friendly policies.\n\nWhile the policy has its benefits, it also comes with some challenges. The company will need to work with employees and managers to ensure that the absence of employees does not impact the company's operations. However, Netflix is confident that this policy will pay off in the long run, as it will attract and retain top talent in the industry.\n\nOverall, Netflix's new policy is a major step forward for the tech industry and sets a new standard for companies to follow.

According to their research, published in the Astronomical Journal, they have found evidence of a ninth planet in our solar system, which they have named \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet 9.\" This new planet is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at a distance of 20 times the average distance of Neptune. The researchers used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of this planet, which they believe is a gas giant with a highly eccentric orbit.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked a lot of excitement and debate among astronomers and the general public. Some scientists, like NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, have expressed caution and skepticism, stating that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" and that the discovery should be confirmed through direct observation. However, Mike Brown, the lead researcher, is confident that the discovery is real and that the planet will be found within the next few years.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is significant because it could potentially change our understanding of the solar system and the definition of a planet. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines a planet as an object that has enough mass to be rounded by its own gravity, orbits the sun, and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Planet Nine fits this definition, and its discovery could lead to a reevaluation of the status of Pluto, which was previously considered a planet but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nMike Brown, the \"Pluto killer,\" has been at the center of the controversy surrounding Pluto's status.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

Jones was also killed. \"The deputies are, of course, understandably shaken up,\" Salazar says. He says the shooting is under investigation, but in his opinion the boy's death is \"a tragic accident.\" Salazar says one deputy is \"adamant\" he saw Jones with a gun and that she threatened to shoot him. He says Jones threatened both police and Kameron's family, who didn't know her, just before deputies opened fire. But investigators haven't been able to locate a gun despite the use of a helicopter and dive team. Salazar says they have found a pipe with Jones' blood on it near the scene of the shooting. One deputy at the scene was wearing a body camera, but he blocked it with his rifle during the shooting. Meanwhile, Kameron is being remembered by those who knew him. \"Kameron was a ball of energy, happy, smart, and could strike up a conversation with anyone,” school counselor Maria Morales tells KSAT. “He also had a great sense of humor and caring heart.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2048}

Markham, a staunch vegan, refused to take her dehydrated newborn to the hospital for treatment, citing her concerns about animal by-products in traditional formula. The baby was taken into state custody and placed in the care of Markham's grandparents after a doctor diagnosed him as dehydrated and losing weight.\n\nAccording to police, Markham was told by a doctor to take her child to the hospital within an hour, but she refused, instead opting to purchase a soy-based formula from Whole Foods Market. She claimed that if the formula was sold at Whole Foods, it must be safe for her newborn. However, police reported that Markham was uncooperative and did not answer the door when they arrived at her apartment.\n\nMarkham was arrested and charged with child neglect, but later bonded out of jail.

According to the study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US are now diagnosed under the age of 50, a number that is expected to rise to one in four by 2030. This alarming trend has sparked a call to action from the medical community to reassess the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening.\n\n**Demographics and Outcomes**\n\nThe study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that 37,847 (15%) of the patients were under 50, with a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with advanced cancer and more aggressive disease. Despite this, younger patients tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence, with a 5-year survival rate of 95.1% for localized disease, 76% for regional disease, and 21.3% for distant disease.\n\n**Symptoms and Screening**\n\nThe study highlights the importance of being aware of the symptoms of colorectal cancer, which can be subtle and non-specific, such as anemia, changes in bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool. Dr. Joel Randolph Hecht, a gastroenterologist, notes that these symptoms are often ignored or attributed to other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or fissures. The study emphasizes the need for primary care physicians to be vigilant in screening for these symptoms, particularly in younger patients.\n\n**Risk Factors and Prevention**\n\nThe study also raises concerns about the increasing rates of colorectal cancer among younger adults, which may be linked to environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, notes that the exact cause of the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults is unclear, but may be related to environmental factors.\n\n**Implications and Future Directions**\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the medical community, with some experts suggesting that screening guidelines for colorectal cancer may need to be revised to reflect the changing demographics of the disease. Dr. Hendren notes that while the data does not support changing screening guidelines to start at a younger age, the study highlights the need for more research to understand the causes of the", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

A rock shelter, known as Warratyi, has been found to contain evidence of human settlement dating back 49,000 years, making it one of the most important prehistoric sites in Australia. The site, located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide, has yielded a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the remains of megafauna such as the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon and the giant bird, Genyornis.\n\nThe discovery was made by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local elder Clifford Coulthard, who were surveying the area when Hamm's colleague needed to use the restroom. The site was initially thought to be around 5,000 years old, but dating of artefacts and fossils has revealed that it is actually 49,000 to 46,000 years old. This pushes back the known dates of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 10,000 years, and shows that humans were able to move quickly into the dry interior of the country.\n\nThe site has also provided evidence of the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia, dating back to 49,000-46,000 years ago. The artefacts found at the site include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, and the remains of megafauna such as the Diprotodon and the Genyornis bird. The presence of these artefacts and fossils in the rock shelter suggests that early humans were interacting with these animals, and possibly hunting them.\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter has been hailed as one of the most important archaeological finds in Australia, and has rewritten the story of Indigenous Australians. The site has provided evidence of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of early Australians, who were able to develop technologies such as stone and bone tools, and interact with the megafauna of the country.\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature, and has been praised by archaeologists and Indigenous Australians alike. The discovery has also sparked debate among archaeologists, with some arguing that the site is older than previously thought, and others arguing that the dating of the artefacts is not as accurate.\n\nOverall, the discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter has provided a significant new chapter in the story of human settlement in Australia, and has shed new light on the ingenuity and resourcefulness of", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Alien Civilizations and the Quest for Energy**\n\nRecent studies and scientific theories suggest that advanced civilizations may be able to harness energy from distant stars to sustain their growth and expansion in the universe. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed the Kardashev scale in 1962 to measure the energy consumption of civilizations, categorizing them into three levels: Level I, which harnesses a planet's resources; Level II, which harnesses a star's energy; and Level III, which harnesses the energy of an entire galaxy.\n\nAccording to a recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the universe's expansion is causing the cosmic horizon to move outward at an accelerating rate. This means that stars beyond our Local Group of galaxies will become inaccessible in approximately 100 billion years, making it essential for advanced civilizations to harvest energy from nearby stars to sustain their growth. To achieve this, Hooper proposes the use of Dyson spheres, a spherical shell of satellites that can capture and harness the energy of a star.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, who suggested that advanced civilizations would recognize their presence through the waste heat they produce, detectable as infrared radiation. These civilizations would likely be of Type III, harnessing the energy of an entire galaxy. To capture the energy of a star, a swarm of satellites, known as statites, would be used to form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, with authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven describing similar structures in their works. These megastructures would be made up of millions of individual satellites, each collecting and harnessing the energy of the star. The concept of Dyson spheres has sparked debate among scientists and astronomers, who are now exploring the possibility of detecting these megastructures and their potential implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nThe search for alien civilizations and their megastructures has become a topic of interest in the scientific community, with scientists and astronomers searching for signs of these structures in the universe. The study of Dyson spheres and megastructures has the potential to reveal new insights into the nature of advanced civilizations and the universe, and may one day lead to the detection of extraterrestrial life.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

Born premature at 3 pounds, Oakleigh has been a fighter since birth, overcoming numerous health challenges. However, her latest battle is with a \"super strain\" of E. coli, a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections.\n\nAccording to her grandfather, Chris Curtis, Oakleigh was born premature and spent time in the NICU, but seemed to be in perfect health for six months. However, she then contracted a bacterial infection, which led to a series of health issues, including a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a dangerous, antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas bacteria. The infection led to kidney reflux, which was diagnosed as stage 3, and the bacteria was resistant to many types of antibiotics.\n\nOakleigh's family is now facing a new challenge with the E. coli infection, which is resistant to many antibiotics.

The firm, which is known for its HGTV show \"Fixer Upper,\" was accused of not taking adequate precautions to protect against lead paint hazards during renovations of homes built before 1978.\n\n**Background**\n\nMagnolia Homes, which operates as Magnolia Homes, is a renovation firm that specializes in renovating older homes in the Waco, Texas area. The company's activities were brought to the EPA's attention after several seasons of its HGTV show \"Fixer Upper\" were reviewed. The show, which aired on HGTV, was viewed by over 3 million households.\n\n**Violations and Settlement**\n\nThe EPA found evidence of noncompliance with the RRP Rule at 33 properties, including failure to obtain certification, assign a certified renovator, provide an approved pamphlet to homeowners, post warning signs, and follow work practice standards. However, Magnolia Homes cooperated with the EPA and took immediate steps to ensure compliance after being contacted by the agency.\n\n**Terms of the Settlement**\n\nAs part of the settlement, Magnolia Homes will pay a civil penalty of $40,000. The company will also take steps to ensure compliance with the RRP Rule in future renovations, including implementing a compliance management program and providing training to its staff. Additionally, Magnolia Homes will create a video to educate the public about lead-based paint hazards and safe renovation practices, which will be released within 90 days.

Three new studies published in the journal Science have revealed that the earliest evidence of modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, dates back to around 300,000 years ago in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya. This is much earlier than previously thought, and challenges the long-held view that these behaviors emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago.\n\nThe studies, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts and his team, have found that the Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin are the oldest of their kind, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. These tools are smaller, more standardized, and more diverse than those found in earlier periods, suggesting a more advanced level of thinking and planning. The tools were made from obsidian, a volcanic glass, which was transported from as far as 55 miles away, indicating a level of organization and cooperation among early human groups.\n\nThe team also found evidence of the use of pigments, such as red and black rocks, which were used to color rocks and possibly to paint themselves or their belongings. This is the earliest evidence of the use of pigments in the African record.\n\nThe findings suggest that early humans in the Olorgesailie Basin were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies and behaviors in response to climate change. The team believes that this was driven by the need to survive in a challenging environment, where food sources were unpredictable and scarce.\n\nThe studies also suggest that the development of complex behaviors, such as art, symbolism, and innovation, was not a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over thousands of years. The team found that the use of pigments, for example, dates back to around 300,000 years ago, and the use of obsidian and other materials was widespread by around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behaviors. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern was not a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over thousands of years.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The removal of the headphone jack has been seen as a move to create a walled garden, where users are forced to use proprietary accessories and pay for the privilege.\n\nOverall, the decision to remove the headphone jack has been met with widespread criticism and outrage, with many calling it a \"stupid\" and \"arrogant\" move by Apple.", "answers": ["Apple presented its new smartphone Wednesday, and nestled in with the iPhone 7's much-ballyhooed features was the disclosure that the company is getting rid of the phone's headphone jack—news that wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim, or much acclaim at all. Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The airline has reduced the number of boarding lanes from five to two, with the first lane reserved for elite and priority passengers, and the second lane for the remaining passengers. This change is part of the airline's efforts to improve the customer experience and reduce the stress associated with boarding.\n\nThe new boarding process is a result of customer feedback and testing at several airports, including Los Angeles International Airport, where it has been in place since February. The airline has also introduced a mobile notification system that alerts passengers when boarding has started, allowing them to plan their arrival at the gate accordingly.\n\nThe new boarding process is part of a broader effort by United to improve its customer experience. The airline has also been working to reduce congestion at gates by encouraging passengers to wait until their boarding group is called, rather than lining up early.\n\nIn addition to the new boarding process, United has also expanded its partnership with several Latin American airlines, including Avianca and Copa Airlines, to provide more choices for customers traveling between the United States and Latin America. The partnership, known as a joint business agreement (JBA), will provide customers with more routes, reduced travel times, and better connectivity.\n\nThe JBA will allow United, Avianca, and Copa Airlines to share resources and coordinate their schedules, routes, and services, providing customers with a more seamless travel experience. The partnership will also enable the airlines to better align their frequent flyer programs, improve airport facilities, and provide more choices for customers.\n\nThe partnership is expected to drive growth in the market, create new jobs, and bring in more investment to the region.

Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

In recent days, Trump's campaign has been under scrutiny for its handling of the media and its policies.\n\n**Trump's Media Rant**\n\nDonald Trump has been at odds with the media, calling it \"disgusting\" and \"corrupt\" for not covering his rallies properly and putting \"false meaning\" into his words. He claims that if the media covered him fairly, he would be beating Hillary Clinton by 20%. Trump has also accused the New York Times of publishing \"fiction\" and has denied that he has ever said that he would change his policies. He has also accused the media of protecting Hillary Clinton and not exposing her as a \"dishonest\" politician.\n\n**Trump's Foreign Policy Plans**\n\nIn a speech scheduled for Monday, Trump is expected to outline his vision for foreign policy, which includes an end to nation-building and a focus on destroying the Islamic State group and other terrorist organizations. He will also propose a new immigration policy that includes a new ideological test for immigrants, which will assess their views on issues like religious freedom.\n\n**Biden's Campaign for Clinton**\n\nVice President Joe Biden will campaign with Hillary Clinton in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he will argue that Trump is the most uninformed presidential nominee in history. Biden will also say that Trump's rhetoric will make Americans less safe and that Clinton is the best choice for the middle class.\n\n**Clinton's New Effort to Woo Latinos**\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign has launched a new effort to woo young, undocumented immigrants, who are eligible to vote. The campaign is hoping to capitalize on Trump's promise to deport them. Clinton's campaign is also focusing on the 27.3 million Latinos eligible to vote in the 2016 election.\n\n**Manafort's Troubles**\n\nDonald Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been under scrutiny for his ties to Russian and Ukrainian politics. A New York Times investigation has revealed that Manafort was involved in a network that was used to loot assets and influence elections. Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has tweeted a link to the article, seemingly criticizing his successor.\n\n**Trump's Low Expectations**\n\nA recent poll has shown that most Americans believe that Russia's hacking of the election did not sway the outcome.

The procedure, which took six hours to complete, was a success, and Kieran is now able to see his new ears for the first time.\n\nKieran was born with a rare condition called microtia, where the external ear is underdeveloped or missing. He was also born deaf and had to undergo several previous operations to implant a hearing aid, which has allowed him to hear 90% of sounds. However, he still wanted to have ears to look like other children and to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones like his friends.\n\nThe surgery was a bilateral reconstruction, meaning both ears were created at the same time, which is a rare procedure. The new ears were designed to match Kieran's mother's ears, which were used as a template. The surgical team at Great Ormond Street Hospital perform about 40 of these operations each year, mostly to create one missing ear.\n\nThe surgery has had a significant impact on Kieran's life, as he was previously bullied at school due to his appearance. His parents are overjoyed with the result and believe that the surgery has given their son a new lease on life. Kieran's confidence has improved significantly, and he is now able to wear sunglasses and earphones like his friends.\n\nThe surgery has also sparked hope for future generations of children with similar conditions.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

This right has been a cornerstone of democracy since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and was enshrined in the United States Constitution. However, in recent years, this right has been threatened by the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which revoked the right to habeas corpus for certain individuals, including those labeled as \"enemy combatants\" by the government.\n\n**The Threat to Habeas Corpus**\n\nThe Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay and those labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This provision has been used to detain individuals, including legal residents of the United States, without cause or trial. The government has little evidence against most of the Guantanamo detainees, with many being sold into captivity by warlords for bounties. Despite numerous legal victories, the government has managed to prevent detainees from getting a fair hearing in court.\n\n**The Fight for Habeas Corpus**\n\nThe fight for habeas corpus is not limited to human rights; it also extends to animal rights. The Nonhuman Rights Project has been fighting for the rights of animals, specifically chimpanzees, to be treated as legal persons. In a groundbreaking case, a New York judge granted a writ of habeas corpus to two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, who are being held in captivity at Stony Brook University. This ruling marks the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been granted a writ of habeas corpus, recognizing them as legal persons.\n\n**The Implications of the Ruling**\n\nThe implications of this ruling are far-reaching, not only for animals but also for human rights. If the government can detain individuals without cause, it sets a precedent for the erosion of civil liberties. The fight for habeas corpus is not just about the rights of animals but also about the fundamental rights of individuals. The ruling in the case of Hercules and Leo sets a precedent for the rights of animals and could sway judges in other jurisdictions to recognize the rights of animals.\n\n**The Future of Habeas Corpus**\n\nThe future of habeas corpus is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the fight for this fundamental right is far from over.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

In 2009, the company was raided by federal marshals in Tennessee, and a similar raid occurred in 2011, with the government seizing wood and shutting down production. The government is preparing to charge the company with trafficking in illegally obtained wood, specifically ebony and rosewood from Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008, requires companies to certify the legality of their wood supply chain. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has investigated Gibson and found that the company knowingly sourced wood from countries with banned exports, including Madagascar. However, Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all their purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also affected other companies in the music industry, including the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., which stopped importing rosewood from Madagascar after a coup in 2009. The company's Chairman and CEO, Chris Martin, supports the law, stating that it is a necessary measure to stop illegal logging.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also raised concerns among guitar manufacturers and dealers, who worry about the law's retroactive nature and the difficulty in proving compliance.

According to NASA scientists, an ocean once covered nearly 20% of the planet's surface, making it a promising place for alien life to emerge and thrive. This ancient ocean, which was up to 137 meters deep, was a major body of water that lasted for millions of years, providing a habitable environment for life to originate and proliferate.\n\nThe study, which used infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere, showed that the water on Mars was enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that the planet had lost a significant amount of water over time. The researchers found that the water loss was due to the thin Martian atmosphere, which allowed the ordinary hydrogen to escape into space, leaving behind the heavier deuterium. This process led to a significant increase in the concentration of deuterium in the Martian water, making it a valuable tool for scientists to estimate the amount of water that once existed on the planet.\n\nThe researchers used the Keck II telescope and the Infrared Telescope Facility to map the Martian atmosphere and study the chemical composition of the water vapor. They found that the water on Mars was once identical to the water on Earth, but over time, the ordinary hydrogen was lost to space, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, his lawyers argue that the trial should have been held outside of Boston due to the city's widespread outrage over the bombings, which made it impossible for him to receive a fair trial. The lawyers claim that the jurors would have been exposed to constant and relentless coverage of the bombings and the defendant's family on social media, which would have prejudiced the trial.\n\nThe lawyers also argue that the death penalty is unconstitutional, citing a recent Supreme Court dissenting opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, who stated that the death penalty is a \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" However, the majority opinion in the same case upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty. The defense team has already indicated two lines of likely appeal: that the trial should not have been held in Boston due to the city's strong emotions surrounding the bombings, and that the defense was not given sufficient time to present a full argument in mitigation that could have convinced the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life.\n\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev's fate will not be decided anytime soon, as the appeals process is expected to take years.

The vehicle crashed into a barrier on the 101 Highway near Mountain View, California, killing the 38-year-old driver, Walter Huang, who was an engineer at Apple. The accident has raised concerns about the safety and reliability of Autopilot, a system that Tesla claims has reduced accidents by 40% in the US.\n\nAccording to Tesla, the accident occurred while Autopilot was engaged, with the adaptive cruise control set to minimum follow distance. The driver had received several visual and audible warnings to take control of the wheel, but failed to do so for six seconds before the collision. The vehicle's logs showed that the driver had a clear view of the barrier for five seconds and 150 meters before the crash, but did not take any action.\n\nThe severity of the accident was attributed to the fact that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier, had been crushed in a previous accident and not replaced. The vehicle's logs also showed that the driver had complained to the dealership about the Autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions, but the issue was not resolved.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and Tesla has released a statement saying that Autopilot \"unequivocally makes the world safer for vehicle occupants, pedestrians, and cyclists.\" The company also pointed out that the crash attenuator had been damaged in a previous accident and had not been replaced.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has stated that they had scheduled maintenance work on the barrier, but was delayed due to weather conditions.

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one. (Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday."], "all_classes": null, "length": 790}

The final round of voting took place on January 25, 2012, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains from earlier rounds. The Islamist group has been gaining momentum, with some estimates suggesting they may win a majority of the seats in the new parliament.\n\nThe elections come as the trial of Mubarak and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, continues. The prosecution has accused Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and of devoting the last decade of his rule to ensuring his son's succession. The trial has been ongoing since August 2011, with the prosecution presenting its case against the former president and his family members.\n\nThe trial has been marked by controversy, with the prosecution calling for the harshest penalty for Mubarak, including the death penalty. The prosecution has also accused Mubarak's security forces of using violence against protesters, leading to the deaths of over 800 people during the uprising.\n\nThe elections have been marked by low voter turnout, with only 14 million eligible voters casting their ballots. The Islamist group's Freedom and Justice party has been gaining momentum, with some estimates suggesting they may win a majority of the seats in the new parliament.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.
